        <h2>Attendance Submission for odd Semester</h2>
        <p>
            As we progress through the <strong>Fall 2024 semester</strong>, we want to remind everyone of the importance of 
            regular class attendance. Faculty members are required to submit attendance lists at the end of each week, 
            and attendance plays a key role in evaluating your participation and engagement in courses.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can track your attendance through the student portal. Make sure to reach out to your course instructors 
        or the academic office if there are any discrepancies in your attendance records.
